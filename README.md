# SOLID-Principles
This repo will contain the SOLID principles, where each principle will have bad code and a good code for correct understanding.

- Single Responsibility Principle:
    This principle states that every interface should have a single responsiblity assigned to it. By providing with extra functionality we tend to disobey the rule.

- Open Close Principle:
    This principle states that every file should be open to extension but closed to changes. That means, when a file is created it should not altered later on because another functionality was added. Instead it     
    fine to extend the file to utilise its functionality.

- Liskov Substitution Principle:
    This principle states that when a file is extends by a child class, it should not alter the functions of the parent class.

- Interface Segregation Principle:
    This principle states that one should be apply to replace sub class with it's interface and still the code should work fine. Meaning, when an interface is implemented, every function of that interface must be       implemented.

- Dependency Inversion Principle:
    This principle states that we should not directly depend on a main classes for implementation instead get an abstract layer for using the classes.
